<h3>Developer API</h3>
<pre>
    <%= petition_path(:id=> ':id') %><b>[.json]</b>
</pre>
<p>For example, to retrieve the text analysis for petition with id '<%= @petition_id %>':</p>
<pre>
    <%= link_to @example_path, @example_path %>
    <%= link_to @example_json_path, @example_json_path %>
</pre>
<p>
    Please note that analysis of petition text is performed asynchronously via calls to external APIs.
    A result will always be returned for each API call, however sometimes the analysis will not have been completed.
    In order to check for analysis results, use the <code>analysis_complete</code> key in the result. If
    <code>analysis_complete</code> is not set, re-run the API call after a few seconds.
    Once analysis has been run for a petition, the results will persist across subsequent calls.
